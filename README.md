**ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) Design – Task Description**
As part of my internship, my first assigned task was to design a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog in the VLSI domain. The objective was to implement an ALU that supports the following operations:

Addition

Subtraction

AND

OR

NOT

**Steps I Followed**:
**Understanding Requirements**:
I started by understanding the functional requirements of the ALU — identifying the operations it should perform and the number of inputs and outputs needed.

**Writing Verilog Code**:
I wrote a Verilog module named alu that takes in two 8-bit inputs (A and B) and a 3-bit operation selector (sel). Based on the sel value, the ALU performs one of the operations and produces an 8-bit output (result).

**Implemented Operations**:

000 → Addition (A + B)

001 → Subtraction (A - B)

010 → Bitwise AND (A & B)

011 → Bitwise OR (A | B)

100 → Bitwise NOT (~A)

**Testbench Development**:
I created a testbench module to simulate and verify the functionality of the ALU. I applied various combinations of inputs and selector values to confirm that each operation works correctly.

**Simulation**:
I simulated the design using tools like ModelSim, observed waveforms, and verified the correctness of the ALU output for different inputs.

**Result Analysis**:
After confirming correct functionality through simulation, I documented the behavior and confirmed that the ALU meets the initial design requirements.
